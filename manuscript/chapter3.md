# Deploying and Configuring TrueSight Pulse

This chapter gets down to the nitty gritty and shows in detail how to configure TrueSight Pulse to monitoring your
small infrastructure. This step by step guide provides specific recipes for monitoring ensuring the up time of your
infrastructure.


## Critical Systems

For your most critical servers the TrueSight Pulse meters should be deployed so as to collect detail information about
availability and performance of these critical systems.

## Less Critical Systems

For less critical system, merely knowing that the system is up and running may be sufficient. In those
cases you can use a meter plugin to perform a check that indicates that the system is running
via a network ping.
